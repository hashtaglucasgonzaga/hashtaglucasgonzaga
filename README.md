## About Me

I'm transitioning from IT infrastructure to **Site Reliability Engineering**, with a focus on observability and monitoring. My background includes nearly a decade managing Windows Server environments in Brazil, and I'm now building expertise in modern observability practices.

I take a methodical approach to learning — preferring to master concepts thoroughly rather than rushing through topics.

- Building monitoring solutions with **Prometheus** and **Grafana**
- Implementing external monitoring with **Blackbox Exporter**
- Mastering **PromQL** for infrastructure (USE) and application (RED) metrics

- Studying **OpenTelemetry** and distributed tracing
